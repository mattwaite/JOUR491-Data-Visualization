\f0\fs24 \cf0 I like how it shows them size comparison with totals because you can see how close they all are in various categories, however the text overlaps which is bad, the colors are not something I'm happy with (they are just what came up when I plugged in the data). \
I almost think it would be more effective to show the overlap of the bars in order to show a better means of how they relate to each other. That way people can see size comparison. }
