I added a title, an X-axis label for Unemployment rate, a background texture, renamed the columns of data, and changed the frequency of the dates on the Y-axis to every 6 months.

What i did, why, and what chart says:

Every Chart needs a title.  I labeled the rate axis for clarity.  I moved the key to the empty portion of the chart to save space, and the texture was just to make it slightly less ugly.

This chart says college graduates are less likely to be unemployed, and those with only a high school education or less are more likely to be unemployed, than the general population.
