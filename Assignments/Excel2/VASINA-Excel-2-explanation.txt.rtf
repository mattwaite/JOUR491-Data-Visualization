\f0\fs24 \cf0 Essentially I was really boring in deciding what I wanted to look at. I thought it would be very interesting to look at the Nebraska schools and their default rates. The best way I could think to do so was with line graphs, because then you can see them in relation to one another. Basically the graphic shows that all the schools in Nebraska have varying default rates over the three year span. }
