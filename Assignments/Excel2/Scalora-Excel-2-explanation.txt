(These two charts are in the Homework tab). 

The first chart compares the average default rate of the universities in the Big 10 and the Big 12.
The story is that Big 12 schools have higher default rates than Big 10 universities, but the default rate for both institutions is rising. 
The rate increases more from 2009-2010 than it increased from 2008-2009, suggesting the effects of the recession kicked in the second set of years.
The default rate peaks at 4.7 percent for Big 12 universities and 3.3 percent for Big 10 schools.



The second chart compares Nebraska's state colleges and the four institutions of the University of Nebraska system. 
The story is the three state schools (Wayne State, Peru State and Chadron State) have the highest default rates. 
UNL has a lower default rate than UNK and UNO, but a higher default rate than the University of Nebraska Medical Center. 
Default rates are decreasing or leveling out for the state colleges, while they are increasing for UNL and UNK. UNO and UNMC's rates, however, are declining.
